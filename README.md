# OpenCV-Unity3DCarGame
This is my attempt to merge OpenCV (object- tracking feature) and unity3d game development. I have tried to move the car in my self created environment using OpenCV. The OpenCV window is divided into two halves in parallel to the x-axis if above the white line the car moves forward. The 5 red lines define the position of 5-tracks in theunity3D environment in which car moves.
This creates an experience of gesture gaming without the usage of sensors.
For object tracking, I have used, Contours and for OpenCV and unity integration I have used Sockets.
For Object Tracking i have used a red bottle cap (coca-cola).
U can find the tutorial video here.
